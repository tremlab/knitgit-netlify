      <h1>Scarf</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Probably the easiest knitting project possible, while still producing a
        practical, gorgeous wardrobe piece!
      </p>
      <p>
        This will be a simple rectangle -- you just need to choose a length and
        width. As always, knitgit patterns assume the same stitch is used
        throughout (no rib trim or single cables anywhere). Maybe you'll want to
        add tassles or fringe at the end, but again - the pattern is just going
        to calculate the basic rectangle for you. Feel free to riff on it from
        there!
      </p>
      <p>
        With a scarf, it's important to choose a stitch that looks good on BOTH
        SIDES. Both sides don't need to be identical, but many pattern stiches
        have a good and bad side. Make sure you'll be happy wearing the scarf
        with both sides of the stitching visible.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a scarf you also want to be wary of choosing a stitch that doesn't
        like to lay flat. Unless you deliberately want the scarf to coil upon
        itself like a tube, it's actually not a great idea to use a straight
        stockinette stitch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some options to consider: rib, moss, or - for retro 80s fabulousness -
        shaker stitch.
