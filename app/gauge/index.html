<h1>Gauge</h1>
<h2>TLDR</h2>
<p>To calculate any of the patterns on this site, you will need to input the gauge. This is the number of stitches across a 4" (10cm) segment, and the number of rows up a 4" (10cm) segment of your knitting with this specifc yarn in this specifc stitch with these specific needles that you plan to use for the project. (this is a standard knittng practice.)</p>
<h2>Interesting Gauge</h2>
<p>The single most important thing in knitting is knowing your gauge and keeping a steady gauge across your project. This is especially important when using knitgit.  The entire pattern will be generated based on the gauge you input, so it's worth taking some time at the beginning to get it right. </p>
<p>All of these patterns assume you are using the exact same gauge throughout the project. Your pattern stitch of choice must be one that can be reproduced every 4 inches (10cm); anything bigger is not recommended for these patterns.</p>
<h2>What is a Gauge?</h2>
<p>A "gauge" represents how many stitch across and how many rows up are needed to create a 4" x 4" (10x10cm) square. MANY factors can impact your gauge, so it is highly recommnded to always take some time at the beginning of your project to actually knit up a small square (at least 4" x 4"). And not only knit it, but BLOCK it, i.e. wash it in whatever way you intend to wash the final gamrent, lay it flat to dry, press it, whatever you expect to be the lifstyle of this final garment, run this swatch through the process once so you can then get an accurate measurement of how many stitches per inch.  Yarn can shrink during wash, stretch during blocking, vary from each knitters personal knitting tension... There is truly no substitute for making a swatch and taking careful measurements before starting a project in earnest. There are tons of resources on the internet if you want to further explore how to make a good swatch sample.</p>
<h2>Be yourself</h2>
<p>With a normal kniting pattern, a gauge is dictated to you. You MUST match your actual knitting sample to the specific gauge, or your project will go haywire. But here at knitgit we want you to do your own thing! Settle into whatever gauge you like with your yarn and your own style, and we will build a pattern around that. ðŸ˜Š</p>
